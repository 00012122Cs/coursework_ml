## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **machine learning pipeline** using a real-world dataset taken from the **World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory**. The aim is to analyze, preprocess, model, evaluate, and deploy a predictive system focused on **Life Expectancy** across different countries, years, and demographic groups.

The coursework includes:
- A full **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data preprocessing** (cleaning, missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Training **three or more ML models**
- **Model evaluation & comparison**
- A **Streamlit multi-page web application**
- Full **reproducibility** (requirements.txt + structured notebooks)
- Version-controlled development with meaningful commits
